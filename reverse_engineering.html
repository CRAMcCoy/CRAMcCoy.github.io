					<h4>Figure 3: Author's hand, covered in petroleum jelly</h4>
					
					<p>This was done by creating a mould by creating a watertight box, which was akin to the size of the original hand, measuring the volume of the box and filling it with alginate mix equal to the volume of the box minus the volume of the original hand. Before inserting the original hand into the mixture, petroleum jelly was applied to ensure the original hand could be removed (see figure 3).</p>

					<h4>Figure 4: Hand-shaped mould filling with liquid resin</h4>
					
					<p>When the alginate mixture was set the original hand was removed, and the now hardened mould was left to dry for 2 hours. When the mould was dried, an amount of epoxy resin was mixed equal to the volume of the original hand (as seen in figure 4). After being left for an hour to fully set, the mould was cut and resin hand was removed, then inspected for blemishes. However, it was a perfect copy, so the process did not need to be repeated (as seen in figure 5).</p>

					<h2>Technical Justification: Box and moulding material</h2>
					
					<p>The box was made from duct tape and small foam boards because they were waterproof materials, extremely cheap and freely available. The box did not need to be used again so the weakness was not a problem.</p>
					<p>Rubber would have held the shape of the mould much longer, since the alginate mould fully dries after a few days and thus shrinks, making the void much larger and introducing cracks to the mould. However, platinum catalysed rubber would have been much more expensive, and required extremely hot temperatures (116-160oc (Avantor, n.d.). It is also much cheaper than tin catalysed rubber, and this would have required 7-10 days to dry (rather than 2 hours). However, alginate was used because there was no need to use the mould more than once, so it did not need to hold their shape for very long.</p>
					<p>Finally, rubber moulding would have posed a serious challenge with regards to getting the real hand out the mould.</p>

					<h2>Industrial Example: Rubber Moulding</h2>
					
					<p>Rubber silicon moulds are extremely useful when materials are set at high temperatures, and/or require high accuracy. It’s self-releasing and elongation properties can also help with materials which do not release well, or expand during their setting process. The high elongation and strength of the material also makes the moulds extremely long-lasting, being able to be used between 30 and 150 times (AZO Materials, 2005). All of these properties make rubber moulds a commonly used technique in the automobile, aerospace, and medical industries to name but a few (Industrial Quick Search Directory, n.d.).</p>
					<p>Firms such as Bentley Advanced Materials use this for clients who are prototyping, since it allows them to create copies of products, even with complex shapes and many material types. (Bentley Advanced Materials, n.d.)</p>

					<h2>Technical Justification: Gravity Casting</h2>
					
					<p>Gravity casting was chosen because of a lack of facilities were available for centrifugal casting and the availability of materials with low viscosity meant that there was no need for the expense of centrifugal casting.</p>

					<h2>Industrial Example: Centrifugal Casting</h2>
					
					<p>Centrifugal casting performs well with products which have a circular shape, or at least a consistent radius (e.g., sphere, tapered cylinder) (Rapiddirect, 2022). A product with an elliptical or polygonal cross section would have material be forced into the edges of the shape. This is especially useful in creating piping with require consistent material around it’s edge to ensure pressure does not cause a rupture, making it common in the aerospace, natural gas and oil industries.</p>
					<p>This technology is also used at the prototyping stage, however by firms such as Advanced Prototype Moulding, which use a slightly different process called rotational moulding where the rotation speed is not enough to create a significant centrifugal force, so the material can flow around the mould and create a hollow product, which allows for more cost effective, short production runs (Advanced Prototype Moulding, 2020), which makes it ideal for prototyping</p>

					<h2>Technical Justification: Casting Material</h2>
					
					<p>Many different materials were considered. Polyester was rejected because it often shrinks after casting (EnvironMolds, n.d.). Acrylic and styrene were also rejected because the resulting material (acrylic glass and polystyrene respectively) would be transparent (A&C Plastics inc, n.d.) (Rogers, 2015), which even with added colour would likely have made the 3D scanning useless.</p>
					<p>The two materials most seriously considered were epoxy resin and polyurethane. Polyurethane is UV resistant, very hard, and scratch resistant. However its relative weakness (Central, 2018) increased the risk that the resin hand would break before it could be scanned. Furthermore the UV resistance was not necessary for the purposes of the project, and any small scratches could be fixed in software later, whereas a fracture would be much more difficult, so the stronger epoxy resin was used. </p>
					<p>Ceramic materials were considered, but the only one which was available and (have have) had a low enough viscosity was plaster of Paris, which was rejected due to the high temperatures created during the setting process (Education, n.d.) created additional safety concerns (Wainwright, 2009).</p>

					<h2>Experiment: Hand Position During Moulding</h2>
					
					<p>The process described is the second attempt which was made to create the resin hand. Despite the low viscosity, the first resin hand had large holes along the surface, which even after filling and sanding were too large to fix (see figure 6).</p>

					<h4 align="center">Figure 6: 3D scan of first resin hand</h4>
					
					<p>This was caused by the position of the hand. Bending the fingers caused small pockets of air to develop which introduced imperfections into the resin hand. The process described in the prior paragraphs was the second attempt, where the original hand was flayed out instead.</p>

					<p>The next task was to take the resin hand and scan it with a handheld 3D scanner (result shown above), which used triangulation to create a 3D mesh. The resin hand was left palm-down and scanned, then since the hand has a rigid shape, it was simply flipped palm-up and rescanned. The software used to capture the scan automatically combined these two scans into a 3D mesh, which was stored in an STL file (which can be seen in figure 8).</p>

					<h2>Technical Justification: 3D Scanning Over Contact Scanning</h2>
					
					<p>3D scanning was chosen over contact scanning because despite the extremely high accuracy (Knicker, 2020), the extremely high cost and lack of availability of contact scanning made it impossible. Furthermore, contact scanning also takes a very long time (Quality Mag, 2013), which would have made experimenting with scanning the original hand impossible (which will be discussed in the next subheading).</p>

					<h2>Industrial Example: Contact Scanning</h2>
					
					<p>Contact scanning’s high accuracy is used extensively in measuring produced artefacts after manufacturing, to improve the production process (Wasy Research, 2022). This allows for production to be made faster, cheaper and at a higher quality.</p>
					<p>This technology is used during reverse engineering by firms such as Status to fully capture the external and internal features of a product using destructive processing and contact scanning, using co-ordinate measuring machines, which are a type of contact scanner (Status, n.d.).</p>

					<h2>Industrial Example: Time Of Flight Scanners</h2>
					
					<p>Time of flight scanners are usually used in manufacturing to give autonomous machines a view of their surroundings and allow for volumetric information gathering for monitoring product quality (Analog, 2023). Since time-of-flight scanners allow for both close and far proximity scanning, it is the natural choice when computer vision requires depth information navigating environments and analysing objects.</p>
					<p>This technology is used in reverse engineering by firms such as EMS3D when they perform 3D scans of large objects, such as airplane exteriors (EMS3D, 2020) (although for internal features they use triangulation), which can be seen here: </p>

					<p>There was an attempt to 3D scan with the original/real hand (see fig 9) and the resin hand (see figure 10), but the real hand was difficult to keep from slightly tremoring or moving, which created errors for the software which put together the scan into an stl file. Therefore, the scan taken of the resin hand was used, since the scan was so clean. </p>
