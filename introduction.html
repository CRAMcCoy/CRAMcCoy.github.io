					<h2>Basic Requirements and Challenges</h2>
					
					<p>The product will need to have some mechanism by which the exoskeleton can be designed to attach to it by. Furthermore, the fingers will need to be slightly flexible to allow for a more natural feel.</p>
					
					
					<p><br>However, the product will need to have a completely rigid palm. Furthermore, these fingers need to be posable, so they need to be connected to the palm with joints. However, the fingers donâ€™t need to have joints along their length. <br></p>
							
					
					<h2>Features not included</h2>
					
					<p>The product being developed is the internal structure of a hand replication, which will be combined with a hard exoskeleton and covered with a silicon skin.</p>
					
					<p><br>The product will need to have the general form of a hand but does not require to exactly match the shape of the hand since this will be achieved by the exoskeleton and does not need to match the aesthetics of a/the hand since this will be completed by the silicon skin.</p>

					<h2>Experimentation</h2>
					<p>Toward the beginning of the process there was an experiment to test if all the functionality of the final product could be completed in one artefact. To test this, a single finger was created, which was made from solid silicon, but with small tubing fed along the inside of the finger, with breaks at the finger joints to allow the tubing to bend. A string was fed through this tubing before being placed into the silicon to allow for the string the be pulled, and the finger to move (as seen in figure 2). There as also experimentation into the texture created using thickening agents and colouring of the finger (both also shown in figure 2)<br></p>

					<h4>Figure 2: Silicon finger experiment</h4>

					<p><br>However, this mechanism did not work, but rather the finger simply compressed along its length, rather than bending. </p>
					<p>Furthermore, this approach to the solution would not have made a final product which was as easily posable, as strong, or as easily repairable. Therefore, it was decided that this approach would be abandoned.</p>
