					<h2>Technical Justification: 3D printing rather than CNC Machining</h2>
					
					<p>The palm and the fingers were 3D printed with PLA plastic and connected with brass screws (as discussed in the prior chapter.)</p>
					
					<p>There were considerations for many other methods of fabrication. Due to prior familiarity with the process, there was consideration regarding using CNC machining to mill material from a block, to create the components, and then drill holes in the correct spaces. However, this was rejected due the expense, time considerations, and wastefulness of the method. Furthermore, this method would also have required much more expensive material than the plastics which had been considered, since the material would need to be resistant to the high temperatures created by the friction.</p>

					<h2>Industrial Example: CNC Machining</h2>
					
					<p>CNC machining is a very broad term, and so is used in many different applications and industries. CNC machining can be used in prototyping or production across the aerospace, medical, electronic etc. sectors (RapidDirect, n.d.). CNC is predominantly used with metals but can be used with some temperature resistant plastics.</p>
					
					<p>Firms such as Ardel Engineering use this technology to both prototype and produce aerospace parts for many different clients, due to the flexible nature of CNC machining (Ardel Engineering, 2022).</p>

					<h2>Technical Justification: 3D printing rather than laser cutting </h2>
					
					<p>Another subtractive method considered was laser cutting, however due to the complexity of the shapes to be cut this was rejected immediately, as well as for the wastefulness and risk of heat adulterating the product’s shape.</p>

					<h2>Industrial Example: Laser Cutting</h2>
					
					<p>Laser cutting is a very versatile technology insofar as it can be used on many different materials such as metals, woods, plastics, and ceramics (Xometry, 2022). Due to the nature of how the laser and the bed are oriented, laser cutting is most often used for cutting shapes out of sheets of material (Qualitech, 2015).</p>
					
					<p>Firms such as Dudley Industries use laser cutting to create “complex”, but 2D designs in sheet metal for clients (Dudley Industries, 2021). As was discussed previously, they also offer further services, to make full products (e.g. folding, welding, adding inserts), since laser cutting is not suited to creating 3D products.</p>

					<h2>Technical Justification: 3D Printing rather than injection moulding</h2>
					
					<p>The final consideration was between injection moulding and 3D printing. Injection moulding would have had an extremely high upfront cost in so far as a mould would need to be created for the palm and finger components. This would have resulted in a longer production process as well. Because this stage of fabrication is merely focusing on producing a prototype for proof-of-concept and evaluation, it was decided that a rapid development approach such 3D printing would be vastly preferable.</p>

					<h2>Industrial Example: Injection moulding</h2>
					
					<p>Injection moulding is one of the commonly used production method for producing plastic products, since it allows for batch production, just-in-time production, and mass production due to the high level of automation available. Thus, it finds application in almost every industry which requires mass produced plastic parts. This technology will be discussed further in the reflection.</p>

					<h2>Technical Justification: 3D Printing Material</h2>
					
					<p>There were several options to choose from when it came to deciding the material used for printing the prototype.</p>
					
					<p>Many materials were excluded by their price or lack of availability, so the remaining selection was ABS, PLA, and TPU. The selection was PLA, so I will present the differences between PLA and the other two materials individually to better explain the choice.</p>
					
					<p>ABS is slightly cheaper than PLA, it also has better flexural strength and lower ductility, so it Is more likely to resist breaking under force, and it more able to return to its original shape after being flexed (Giang, n.d.). However, due to the lower printing temperature required for PLA printing it allowed for more accurate printing, which was critical due to the need for the joints to be rigid enough to pose the hand, but loose enough that the fingers would not break under the stress of posing. Therefore, the increased accuracy of PLA made it the obvious material of the two.</p>
					
					<p>The choice between PLA and TPU was not so easy, however. TPU is stronger, more flexible, and more durable than PLA (Barret, 2021). It also does not have PLA’s risk of cracking. However, the ease of printing and affordability made PLA a better choice for printing prototype parts.</p>
					
					<p>Finally, PLA was also deemed to be the more environmentally friendly material since it is considered biodegradable. Although, this biodegradability is mostly only effective in an industrial environment (Bohlooli, 2021), it is still much better than the material being burned or put in a landfill which is what happens to most plastics, regardless of recyclability (Editor, 2022).</p>

					<h2>Experiment: Flexibility of compliant mechanisms</h2>
					
					<p>After the parts had finished printing the fingers were tested for their flexibility, by holding both ends and flexing them until failure. The compliant mechanisms made them so that they were rather weak, but the material was much more flexible than PLA would have allowed them to be otherwise, to this demonstrates well the benefits and drawbacks of the designs.</p>
