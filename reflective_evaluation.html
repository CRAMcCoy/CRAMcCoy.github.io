						<p>The exoskeleton was never created, since the group member who was tasked with creating it stopped working on the project very late into development.</p>
						
						<p>The silicon skin was not created in line with the product plan, which was discussed during the team meetings, during the reverse engineering process and on the Microsoft Teams chat. The group member tasked with creating the silicon skin instead created a solid silicon copy of the resin hand, which had no ability or space to be coupled with either the exoskeleton or the internal structure. Moreover, the resin hand was destroyed in the process of its production, so to create the silicon skin, the 3D scan of the original hand would need to be 3D printed, or another resin hand would need to be created, which could be used to create a mould from. However, the production was completed too late into development to rectify this mistake within the timeframe.</p>

						<h1>Reflection on the quality of the internal structure as a unit</h1>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content align-left inner">
						<p>Using brass bolts to join the fingers and the palm was a good decision insofar as it provided a moderate level of resistance which was excellent. However, this meant that the bolt heads sat on top of the joint holes. This may have caused problems for the exoskeleton, so it may have been preferable to add a chamfer to the holes to allow the boltheads to sit within the palm’s volume.</p>
						
						<p>The material choice and fabrication method were good for prototyping, but this would not be appropriate if the product was put into production. Injection moulding is the most popular production method for plastic in the modern manufacturing industry (TWI, n.d.). This would be much more appropriate for production because although the upfront cost is still high, if there were more produced the marginal cost of the products would be much lower than the cost of 3D printed products.</p>
						
						<p>Having said that, it should be said that in reflection TPU would have been a better material to use, since this would have allowed for better testing of the compliant mechanism’s ability.</p>
						
						<p>The fingers should have been shorter and be given their full shape by the exoskeleton. This would make them must stronger, since the force to break a beam in proportional to the inverse square of its length (MechaniCalc, 2019), meaning that if the finger were made 25% of its current length it would be 16x stronger. This would also make the fingers much cheaper to produce, since there would be less material required to produce the fingers.</p>
						
						<p>The compliant mechanisms in the fingers were a very good feature and should be a feature to keep, even if the fingers are made shorter, since it allows the exoskeleton to be made of a more flexible material, since the complaint mechanisms increase the flexibility of the component. However, with the decrease in length and thus a decrease in the number of bends in the finger, it would be beneficial to add another way for the exoskeleton to attach to the internal structure, since there will be fewer points of failure. It may be best to simply add holes into the faces of the bends which are “flat” (i.e., in the middle of two right angles, at the base of the curve) and create the exoskeleton to connect to those also, to fix the problem.</p>
						
						<p>In conclusion, the internal structure prototype was a success, and helped to inform improvements which could be made to the component, if the product were taken to large-scale production. However, it could not be assessed regarding the full product, since the other two components were not created.</p>
