						<h2>How well did the internal structure perform in the finished product?</h2>
						<p>The exoskeleton was never created, since the group member who was tasked with creating it stopped attending university<br><br>
						The silicon skin was not created in line with the product plan, which was discussed during the team meetings, during the reverse engineering process and on the Microsoft Teams chat. Instead of a silicon <strong>skin</strong>, the group member tasked with creating the silicon <strong>skin</strong> created a solid silicon copy of the resin hand, which had no ability or space to be coupled with either the exoskeleton or the internal structure. It also had no internal tubing or string like the first experiment (described in the introduction), to give it any kind of movement or functionality. Moreover, the resin hand was destroyed in the process of its production, so to create the silicon skin, the 3D scan of the original hand would need to be 3D printed, or another resin hand would need to be created, which could be used to create a mould from.<br><br>
						Therefore, the hand can only be evaluated on its own, rather than in the full context of the final product, since the other two components were not created (to specification).</p>
